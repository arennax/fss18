DP is a kind of neural net achitecture where the outputs on N i become the inputs to net i+1. 
Deep learning methods are representation-learning methods with multiple levels of representation, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules that each transforms the representation at one level (starting with the raw input) into a representation at a higher, slightly more abstract level. Compared to the conventional machine learning algorithms, deep learning methods are very good at exploring high-dimensional data.


It has received a  lot of press lately. 

A. lot. of. press.

The comptuational requirements for this method are challenging. 
One NCSU grad student wroking at Google this summer was running 3 years of CPU per day (no joke) for his
DL experimetns. While that that is certainly an extreme example, it does illustrate how costly it can be to tune DL networks. Literally, costly. We
costed out one project where 4 students would use comeercial GPU clusters to run 20 experimetns per week for 3 years. That work would add $1M to the cost
of that grant.

So it seem  DL is the answer, what was the question? If was ask what kind of learners do we need, then work backwards from there, do we get to DL?

Perhaps not. Suppose we dont need a classifier, but a planner. In that case, DL might become part of a larger system than uses some classifer as a what-if query device to test differernt plans.

And if we want an explanation system, then we 'd have to use some symbolic method to run over the same examples as DL to build a second odel (and its that model we can show to users).

Of course, sometimes DL is ncesessary. Some domains have such frightenningly complex data that layers of neural networkds are requreided to tease out the complexities of the data.

But sometimes, DL is not ncesessay. And in that case, it seems silly to incur the  comptuational cost of DL. So far, in SE< the case for the superioty of DL other
other methods has not been made:
