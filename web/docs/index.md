## Why?


Here is a pressing question;

- The future of SE is [more and more AI](future).
- AI software is still software;
- As society uses more AI, SE folks will be required to us and maintain and extend that software;
- So how should SE people look at AI software? 
      - What should they expect from that software?
      - What would be an AI software  "bad smells" that prompts a code reorganization?

Enter this subject.

## What?

How to teach software how to be a scientist

- Automatically build, critique, and revise models.

How to build and modify and refactor and remix and repurpose:

- Software for data miners;
- Software for optimizers;
- Software for theorem provers.
- To help your customers achieve their dreams, better, faster, cheaper.


How to achieve maximum AI benefits at minimal AI costs:

- By recognize and modify bias in learners.
- By reducing the  CPU and memory footprints of AI;
- By respecting the privacy of citizens in a society shared with AI.

## How?

Monthly:

- August = Start-up
- September = Data mining
- October = Optimizers and theorem provers
- November = Your do your own big project that utilizes the tools and perspectivs of this sibject.

Weekly (till mid-October):

- Small, simple programming assignments
- Regular poster presentations by students on some tiny aspect of AI+SE
