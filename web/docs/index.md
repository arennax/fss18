Most software companies now learn their policies via data-driven methods. Modern practitioners treat every planned feature as an experiment, of which only a few are expected to survive. Key performance metrics are carefully monitored and analyzed to judge the progress of a feature. Even simple design decisions such as the color of a link are chosen by the outcome of software experiments.

This subject will explore methods for generating and using models built from data (i.e. how to  collectthat data; exploring that data; then presenting that data in such a way to support business-level decision making for software projects).


Graduates of this class will no longer be **consumers** of AI software. 

- Rather, they will be the **producers** of the next generation of  software engineers that build and maintain new AI tools.


For more admin details, see the [syllabus](syllabus.md).

## Why?

In this subject we ask the question: if [deep learning](lectures/deeplearning) is the answer, what was the question?
We ask ["what kind of learners do we need?"](lectures/baselines)  then work backwards from there to design new AI methods, or
improve existing ones.

This is an important task since the following is a very pressing issue:

- The future of SE is [more and more AI](history.md).
- But AI software is still software;
- So as society uses more AI, SE folks will be required to use and maintain and extend that software;
- So how should SE people look at AI software? 
      - What should they expect from that software?
      - What would be an AI software  "bad smells" that prompts a code reorganization?

Enter this subject.

## What?

How to teach software how to be a scientist

- Automatically build, critique, and revise models.

How to build and modify and refactor and remix and repurpose:

- Software for data miners;
- Software for optimizers;
- Software for theorem provers.
- To help society, and our customers, achieve their dreams better, faster, and cheaper.


How to achieve maximum AI benefits at minimal AI costs:

- By recognize and modify bias in learners.
- By reducing the  CPU and memory footprints of AI;
- By respecting the privacy of citizens in a society shared with AI.

## How?

Monthly:

- August = Start-up
- September = Data mining
- October = Optimizers and theorem provers
- November = Your do your own big project that utilizes the tools and perspectivs of this sibject.

Weekly (till mid-October):

- Small, simple programming assignments
- Regular poster presentations by students on some tiny aspect of AI+SE
