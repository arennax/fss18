# Simple. Please.


Less complexity in the analysis:

- less CPU
- less cost (local hardware, cloud services)
- less energy consumption
- support the edge
- less pollution creating that energy
- simpler explanation
- simpler customization
- quicker more effective training
- easier experimentation
- easier reproducibility
- solutions more trustable
- because we need a baseline
- cause its just good science


## less CPU

- getting out of hand
     - The mark Harman paper
- wei-style inference: $1,100,000 for 5 students for 3 years

- zhea : 3 years of CPU/day
