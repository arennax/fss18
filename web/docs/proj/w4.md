# Homework Week4

## Todo

1. The usual instructions. Directory = `w4`.
2. Write a table class that reads in data from disk, and maintains one
   `num` or `sym` instance for each column.as you read in data from disk,
   update each header, incrementally.
3. When the data quits, spit out the statistic on each column. You results should look something like the following:



[weather.csv](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/data/weather.csv),

```
                n       mode    frequency       
1	outlook	14	sunny	5
3	wind	14	FALSE	8
4	!play	14	yes	9

                        n       mu      sd
2	$temp	14	73.57	6.57
```

[weatherLong.csv](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/data/weatherLong.csv),

```
                        n       mode    frequency       
1	%outlook	28	sunny	10
4	wind	        28	FALSE	16
5	!play	        28	yes	18

                        n       mu      sd
2	$temp	28	73.57	6.45
3	<humid	28	81.64	10.09
```

[auto.csv](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/data/auto.csv),

```
                        n       mode    frequency       
1	%cylinders	398	4	204
7	origin		398	1	249

                        n       mu      sd
2	$displacement	398	193.43	104.27
3	$horsepower	392	104.47	38.49
4	<weight		398	2970.42	846.84
5	>acceltn	398	15.57	2.76
6	$model		398	76.01	3.70
8	>mpg		398	23.84	8.34
```

Before the last data set: some of its numbers are "?" which means "do not know". You'll have to skip over that code.

## Sample code (in Lua)

-  This files reads in data. The first row is translated into a column header and the others
   into rows of data [rows.lua](http://menzies.us/lean/rows.html).
