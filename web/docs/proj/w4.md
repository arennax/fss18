# Homework Week4

## Todo

1. The usual instructions. Directory = `w4`.
2. Write a table class that reads in data from disk, and maintains one
   `num` or `sym` instance for each column.as you read in data from disk,
   update each header, incrementally.
3. When the data quits, spit out the statistic on each column. You results should look something like the following:



[weather.csv](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/data/weather.csv),

```
                n       mode    frequency       
1	outlook	14	sunny	5
3	wind	14	FALSE	8
4	!play	14	yes	9

                        n       mu      sd
2	$temp	14	73.57	6.57
```

[weatherLong.csv](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/data/weatherLong.csv),

```
                        n       mode    frequency       
1	%outlook	28	sunny	10
4	wind	        28	FALSE	16
5	!play	        28	yes	18

                        n       mu      sd
2	$temp	28	73.57	6.45
3	<humid	28	81.64	10.09
```

[auto.csv](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/data/auto.csv),

```
                        n       mode    frequency       
1	%cylinders	398	4	204
7	origin		398	1	249

                        n       mu      sd
2	$displacement	398	193.43	104.27
3	$horsepower	392	104.47	38.49
4	<weight		398	2970.42	846.84
5	>acceltn	398	15.57	2.76
6	$model		398	76.01	3.70
8	>mpg		398	23.84	8.34
```

Before the last data set: some of its numbers are "?" which means "do not know". You'll have to skip over that code.

## Sample code (in Lua)

-  This files reads in data. The first row is translated into a column header and the others
   into rows of data [rows.lua](http://menzies.us/lean/rows.html) for a function that returns true
   if the goals in `row1` dominate `row2`.
-  See `domws` in the same file that compares each row to `Lean.dom.samples=100` others
   to count how often this row dominates 100 others. This becomes the dom score (diided by 100
   to be a number 0..1).



The directory
[https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/tests/](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/tests/)
contains unit tests for  in `sample.lua`, `num.lua`, `sym.lua`.
which are
(respectively)
a _reservoir sampler_ ;
a _Gaussian sampler_; and a
_entropy sampler_.


Port the unit tests to my test engine method `O.k`. Use those tests to check your Python versions of
`sample.lua`, `num.lua`, `sym.lua` in
[https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/src/](https://github.com/timm/lean/blob/master/src/).
