# Homework Week1, Week2


## Todo

1. Create a public Github repo (NOT in NC State Github, but in the other one) 
2. Add "timm" as a team member to that repo. How? 
     - go the repo's organization's settings
     - on left-hand-side menu go to Collaberators and teams
     - then Enter "timm" under "Collaborators".
3. Start a file with the following header (containing `class O`).
4. For Week1, address the _Python101_ task.
5. For Week2, address the _Table reader_ task.

Commit the code (w1.py, w2.py) and a transcript of the output (called w1.txt,
w2.txt) to a sub-directory in your repo called `w12`. 

Paste  a link to that directory in the commit sheet.

## A Simple Unit Test Rig (in Python)

```python
import re,traceback

class O:
  y=n=0
  @staticmethod
  def report():
    print("\n# pass= %s fail= %s %%pass = %s%%"  % (
          O.y,O.n, int(round(O.y*100/(O.y+O.n+0.001)))))
  @staticmethod
  def k(f):
    try:
      print("\n-----| %s |-----------------------" % f.__name__)
      if f.__doc__:
        print("# "+ re.sub(r'\n[ \t]*',"\n# ",f.__doc__))
      f()
      print("# pass")
      O.y += 1
    except:
      O.n += 1
      print(traceback.format_exc()) 
    return f
```

### Test rig, in action

- Functions are called
as a side-effect of load the file.
- The function comment is something
the above rig prints out. 
- If assertions fail, it prints
the error but keeps on going to run the other tests.

```python
@O.k
def testingFailure():
  """this one must fail.. just to
  test if the  unit test system is working"""
  assert 1==2

@O.k
def testingSuccess():
  """if this one fails, we have a problem!"""
  assert 1==1

if __name__== "__main__":
  O.report()
```

For example, if you load this file with

     python3 thisfile.py

you will see

    -----| testingFailure |-----------------------
    # this one must fail.. just to
    # test if the  unit test system is working
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "w1.py", line 29, in k
        f()
      File "w1.py", line 52, in testingFailure
        assert 1==2
    AssertionError

    -----| testingSuccess |-----------------------
    # if this one fails, we have a problem!
    # pass

    # pass= 1 fail= 1 %pass = 50%

Note the last line (number of passes and failes in the code).

## Task1: Python101

- Read [Basic Python](../pdf/python201.pdf) 
- Write 27 functions like `testingSuccess` (above)
that demonstrate you understand that the code on pages 5 to 33, skipping p21 (so one function
for one thing on each page).


## Task2: Sample Table Data (that we want to read)

Suppose we need to read in a table.

```python
DATA1 ="""
outlook,$temp,?humidity,windy,play
sunny,85,85,FALSE,no
sunny,80,90,TRUE,no
overcast,83,86,FALSE,yes
rainy,70,96,FALSE,yes
rainy,68,80,FALSE,yes
rainy,65,70,TRUE,no
overcast,64,65,TRUE,yes
sunny,72,95,FALSE,no
sunny,69,70,FALSE,yes
rainy,75,80,FALSE,yes
sunny,75,70,TRUE,yes
overcast,100,25,90,TRUE,yes
overcast,81,75,FALSE,yes
rainy,71,91,TRUE,no"""

```

Then we need to learn the type of the data (on row1) which in this case is

- numeric (if name has "_$_");
- ignrore this column (if name has "_>_");
-  string, otherwise.

And some tables of data are more challenging that others. Here's one where

- there are comments (after a "_#_");
- rows can continue onto the next line (if they end in ",");
- there can be blank lines in the file

```python

DATA2 ="""
    outlook,   # weather forecast.
    $temp,     # degrees farenheit
    ?humidity, # relative humidity
    windy,     # wind is high
    play       # yes,no
    sunny,85,85,FALSE,no
    sunny,80,90,TRUE,no
    overcast,83,86,FALSE,yes

    rainy,70,96,FALSE,yes
    rainy,68,80,FALSE,yes
    rainy,65,70,TRUE,no
    overcast,64,
        
                  65,TRUE,yes
    sunny,72,95,FALSE,no
    sunny,69,70,FALSE,yes
    rainy,75,80,FALSE,yes
          sunny,
                75,70,TRUE,yes
    overcast,100,25,90,TRUE,yes
    overcast,81,75,FALSE,yes # unique day
    rainy,71,91,TRUE,no"""

```
Regardless of those details, when we read both these strings, we see as output

     ['outlook', '$temp', 'windy', 'play']
     ['sunny', 85.0, 'FALSE', 'no']
     ['sunny', 80.0, 'TRUE', 'no']
     ['overcast', 83.0, 'FALSE', 'yes']
     ['rainy', 70.0, 'FALSE', 'yes']
     ['rainy', 68.0, 'FALSE', 'yes']
     ['rainy', 65.0, 'TRUE', 'no']
     ['overcast', 64.0, 'TRUE', 'yes']
     ['sunny', 72.0, 'FALSE', 'no']
     ['sunny', 69.0, 'FALSE', 'yes']
     ['rainy', 75.0, 'FALSE', 'yes']
     ['sunny', 75.0, 'TRUE', 'yes']
     ['overcast', 100.0, '90', 'TRUE']
     ['overcast', 81.0, 'FALSE', 'yes']
     ['rainy', 71.0, 'TRUE', 'no']

### Functions

The following functions implement the table reader.

```python

def lines(s):
  "Return contents, one line at a time."
  yourCodeHere()

def rows(src):
  """Kill bad characters. If line ends in ',' 
   then join to next. Skip blank lines."""
  yourCodeHere()


def cols(src):
  """ If a column name on row1 contains '?', 
  then skip over that column."""
  yourCodeHere()


def prep(src):
  """ If a column name on row1 contains '$', 
  coerce strings in that column to a float."""
  yourCodeHere()

```

### Test cases

```python

def ok0(s):
  for row in prep(cols(rows(lines(s)))):
    print(row)

@O.k
def ok1(): ok0(DATA1)

@O.k
def ok2(): ok0(DATA2)
```
