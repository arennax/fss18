#  SE + AI: then and now

![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DMxOpvFWsAMR8Fp.jpg)

SE's past is full of cases where

- someone declared "X" was not part of SE
- then we ignored them and added "X" to SE
- and lots of things got lots better

### e.g. "SE is not about requirements engineering" <font color="#CC0000" <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down fa-lg"></i> </font>

e.g.  From [Boehm, Keynote, 2004](http://ase-conferences.org/ase/past/ase2004/download/KeynoteBoehm.pdf), slide 8:

- "The notion of 'user' cannot be precisely defined, and therefore has no place in CS or SE." 
       - Edsger Dijkstra, ICSE 4, 1979
- "Analysis and allocation of the system requirements is not the responsibility of the SE group but is a prerequisite for their work." 
       - Mark Paulk at al., SEI Software CMM\* v.1.1, 1993

### e.g. "Programmning  is not about testng" <font color="#CC0000" <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down fa-lg"></i> </font>

e.g. [Harlin Mills, 1984](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9141/281be67750c291d12f4ddf92417aaa6625f6.pdf)
: software engineers should write, but not run or test, their own software

- "Cleanroom software engineering"
- No unit testing (instead, mathematical verification)
     - so before we run anything, we write perfect code
- And there is a seperate testing team to the programming team

### e.g. "Programming  is not about deploying software"  <font color="#CC0000" <i class="fa fa-thumbs-o-down fa-lg"></i> </font>

- Before devops, the coding team used to hand off the system to the production team
- Now we do much less of that.. achieving must faster change cycles

### So the question is....

Q: What is currently "not" SE, but soon must be?    
A: AI

## SE: the future

From [Software
Analytics:
What’s Next?](http://menzies.us/pdf/18analytics.pdf), IEEE Software, Sept/Oct 2018:

"Consider the rise of the data scientist in industry. 

- Many organizations now pay handsomely to hire large teams of data scientists. 
- For example, at the time of this writing, there are more than 1,000 Microsoft employees exploring project data using software analytics. 
- These teams are performing tasks that a decade ago would have been called cutting-edge research. 
- But now we call that work _standard operating procedure_."


"Every innovation also offers new opportunities. 

- There is a flow-on effect from software analytics to other AI tasks outside of software engineering. 
- Software analytics lets software engineers learn about AI techniques, all the while practicing on domains they understand (i.e., their own development practices). 
- Once developers can apply
data-mining algorithms to their data, they can build and ship innovative AI tools. 
- While sometimes those tools solve software engineering problems (e.g., recommending what to change in source code), they can also be used on a wider range of problems. 
- That is, we see software analytics as the training ground for the next generation of AI-literate software engineers working on applications such as image recognition, large-scale text mining, autonomous cars,  drones,
     etc."

"What is the most
important technology newcomers should learn to make themselves better at data science (in general) and software analytics (in particular)? 

- "To answer this question, we need a workable definition of “science,” which we take to mean a community of people collecting, curating, and critiquing a set of ideas. 
    - In this community, everyone does each other the courtesy to try to prove this shared pool of ideas.
- By this definition, most data science (and much software analytics) is not science. 
    - Many developers use software analytics tools to produce conclusions, and that’s the end of the story. 
    - Those conclusions are not registered and monitored. 
    - There is nothing that checks whether old conclusions are now out of date (e.g., using anomaly detectors). 
    - There are no incremental revisions that seek minimal changes when updating old ideas.

"If software analytics really wants to be called a science, then it needs to be more than just a way to make conclusions about the present. 

- Any scientist will tell you that all ideas should be checked, rechecked, and incrementally revised. 
- Data science methods such as software analytics should be a tool for assisting in complex discussions about ongoing issues.
- Which is a long-winded way of saying that the technology we most need to better understand software analytics and data science is ... science."
