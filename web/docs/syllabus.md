## Synopsis

Most software companies now learn their policies via data-driven methods. Modern practitioners treat every planned feature as an experiment, of which only a few are expected to survive. Key performance metrics are carefully monitored and analyzed to judge the progress of a feature. Even simple design decisions such as the color of a link are chosen by the outcome of software experiments.

This subject will explore methods for designing data collection experiments; collecting that data; exploring that data; then presenting that data in such a way to support business-level decision making for software projects.


## Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to

- Build and modify and refactor and remix and repurpose AI software (data miners, optimizers, theorem provers);
- Report on complex technical  issues (spoken talk)
- Report on complex technical  issues (written talk)
- Discuss issues associated with applying the above to help society, and customers, achieve their goals better, faster, and cheaper.

## Prerequisite 

Note that this is a
**programming-intensive** subject. A programming
background is required in a contemporary language
such as Java or C/C++ or Python. Hence,he
prerequisite for this class is 510, Software
Engineering. Significant software industry
experience may be substituted, at the instructorâ€™s
discretion.  Students in this class will work in
Python, but no background knowledge of that language
will be assumed.

## Suggested texts

none

## Expected Workload

Sometimes, the lecturer/tutor will require you to attend a review session during their consultation  time. There, students may be asked to review
code, concepts, or comment on the structure of the course. Those sessions are mandatory and failure to attend will result in marks being deducted.

Also, this is tools-based subject
and it is required that students learn and use those
tools (Python, repositories, etc).  Students MUST be
prepared to dedicate AT LEAST 5-8 working hours a
week to this class (excluding the time spent in the
classroom). Laboratory instruction is not included
in this subject (but the first three weeks will be
spent on some in-depth programming tutorials). Note
that the workload for masters and Ph.D. students
will be different (see above).

## Grades

The following grade scale will be used:

+ A+  (97-100), A (93-96), A-(90-92)
+ B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B-(80-82)
+ C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C-(70-72)
+ D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-(60-62)
+ F (below 60).

Grades will be added together using:


+ Weekly solo homeworks (till October): 8 marks (8 homeworks 1 mark each)
     - Homeworks can be resubmitted till you get full marks on them. But:
     - But no homeworks will be accepted after October 15.
     - And once you submit homework i+1, your marks for homework 1..i will freeze.
     - And only 2 homeworks (max) will be marked per student per week (this includes resubmissions)
     - And you will lose 0.5 marks for any week where you do not submit a homework
+ Mid-term Oct 28 (on terminology): 22  marks
+ Solo poster (on current  directions in foundations of software science): 10 marks
    - 2 page paper
        - Posters are 2 pages pdf in [ACM format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
        - Sample posters can be found [here](http://www.educationaldatamining.org/EDM2016/proceedings/edm2016_postersdemos.pdf)
        - Topic: Posters will explain some interesting aspect on some paper on some work NOT authored by Menzies.  Something on data mining and/or search-based SE and/or thorem proving **as applied to some SE task**
        - To find examples of that work, see papers **after 2012** from top SE-venues
             - [Google scholar, top SE-venues](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&hl=en&vq=eng_softwaresystems)
	     - In particular, ICSE, TSE, JSS, IST, MSR, ESE, ASE,  TOSEM, ICSM (now ICSME)
        - Poster may burrow definitions and graphics from the paper they are reviewing. BUT. Anything the student must be able to explain
          in further detail anything they put into their poster.
    - Presentation (5 mins talk, 5 mins questions) 10 marks
           - No slides
           - Instead, place your 2 page paper under the podium camera, then talk to the content.
           - **IMPORTANT** : Prior to class, post your paper to [the give site](http://tiny.cc/fss18give). Otherwise, lose 1 mark.
+ Big project (due end November) on automated SE): 25 (essay) 15 (presentation) 10 (code review)
    - Project must present two implementations
           - An initial implementation which you will critize using our [baseline criteria](lectures/baseline.md)
           - A second implementation  where the initial implementation is augmented with the concepts of this subject
           - Note that merely doing some existing standard data mining project **will NOT** be sufficcient
    - Paper are 8+ pages pdf in [ACM format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
    - The code review will be the lecturer reading the code checking that the implementation is above a minimum level of effort.
    - Presentations will start mid-November
    - Paper is not due till Dec 1.

Note that:

- master students will do the big project in groups of 3. All other work is solo.
- All submissions will be posted to [the submit site](http://tiny.cc/fss18give). Take long urls and shorten them with (e.g.) tiny.cc before psiting.


## Attendance

Attendance is extremely important for your learning
experience in this class. Once you reach three
unexcused absences, each additional absence will
reduce your attendance grade by 10%.

Except for officially allowed reasons, your presence in the class if required from day one.
Late-comers will have to work in their own solo groups (to avoid disruptions to existing groups).

Note that absences for weddings (your own, or someone else's, is not an offically allowed reason).

Exceptions: this subject  will support students who are absent for any of the following
officially allowed reasons:

- Anticipated Absences (cleared with the instructor before the absence).
Examples of anticipated situations include
    - representing an official university function, e.g., participating in a professional meeting, as part of a judging team, or athletic team;
    - required court attendance as certified by the Clerk of Court;
    - religious observances as verified by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs (DASA).
    - Required military duty as certified by the student's commanding officer.
- Unanticipated Absences.  Excuses must be reported to the instructor not more than one week after the return to class.  Examples of unanticipated absences are:
      -  Short-term illness or injury affecting the ability to attend or to be productive academically while in class, or that could jeopardize the health of the individual or the health of the classmates attending.  Students must notify instructors prior to the class absence, if possible, that they are temporarily unable to attend class or complete assignments on time.
      -  Death or serious illnesses in the family when documented appropriately.  An attempt to verify deaths or serious illness will be made by the Division of Academic and Student Affairs.

That support will include changing the schedule of deliverables and/or (in extreme
case) different grading arrangements.


## Academic Integrity

Cheating will be punished to the full extent permitted. Cheating
includes plagerism of other people's work. All students will be working
on public code repositories and **informed reuse** is encouraged where
someone else's product is:

+ Imported and clearly acknowledged (as to where it came from);
+ The imported project is understood, and
+ The imported project is significantly extended.

Students are encouraged to read each others code and repor **uninformed reuse**
to the lecturer. The issue will be explored and, if uncovered,
cheating will be reported to the university
and marks will be deducted if the person who is doing the reuse:

+ Does not acknowledge the source of the product;
+ Does not exhibit comprehension of the product when asked about it;
+ Does not significantly extend the product.

All students are expected to maintain traditional
standards of academic integrity by giving proper
credit for all work.  All suspected cases of
academic dishonesty will be aggressively pursued.
You should be aware of the University policy on
academic integrity found in the Code of Student
Conduct.

The  exams will be done individually.  Academic integrity is important.  Do not work together on the exams: cheating on either will be punished to the full extent permitted.

## Disabilities

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students
with verifiable disabilities. In order to take
advantage of available accommodations, students must
register with Disability Services for Students at
1900 Student Health Center, Campus Box 7509,
919-515-7653. For more information on NC State's
policy on working with students with disabilities,
please see the Academic Accommodations for Students
with Disabilities Regulation(REG 02.20.01).

Students are responsible for reviewing the PRRs
which pertain to their course rights and
responsibilities. These include:

discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color,
religion, creed, sex, national origin, age,
disability, veteran status, or sexual orientation is
a violation of state and federal law and/or NC State
University policy and will not be
tolerated. Harassment of any person (either in the
form of quid pro quo or creation of a hostile
environment) based on race, color, religion, creed,
sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran
status, or sexual orientation also is a violation of
state and federal law and/or NC State University
policy and will not be tolerated.

+ Note that, as a lecturer, I am legally required to
  **report** all such acts to the campus policy.

Retaliation
against any person who complains about
discrimination is also prohibited. NC State's
policies and regulations covering discrimination,
harassment, and retaliation may be accessed at
